        <p>NABARD’s golden initiative

          The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) initiated a noble program where it trained the farmers for modern farming techniques. Mr. Balu Darade participated in this program as he wished to yield more than 100 quintal, his average produce.
          
          Goodbye to traditional techniques
          
          The traditional method of sowing on flat beds was replaced by raised beds. Following are the advantages of raised bed sowing –
          
          Water can be supplied through drip irrigation
          The temperature can be maintained in raised bed sowing
          Spacing can be easily maintained
          Drip irrigation
          Raised bed sowing allowed the water to be supplied through drip irrigation, a method which has its own advantages –
          
          Drip irrigation reduces water wastage
          Evaporation is minimal and the consumption is lowered
          Fertilisers can be used via the dripping system
          The land between the plant rows remain dry and unwanted plant growth is prevented
          Apart from the good yield, the new techniques helped him save labour cost for irrigation, fertiliser application and removal of weeds. And guess what, he saved around Rs. 6,000 per acre.</p>
